This repository includes classification over benign and malicious applications using WEKA library. It includes feature selection using infor gain(Pearson cor), SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Mulyiple ROC curve is also visualized.

The R codes are another approach for classication of benign and malicious apps. I used Eclat for extracting itemset for utilizing as featureset and classifing using machine learning. We also used SMOTE for imbalance data.
