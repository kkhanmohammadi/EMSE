This repository includes classification over benign and malicious applications using WEKA library. It includes feature selection using infor gain(Pearson cor), classification methods using SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Mulyiple ROC curve is also visualized.

The R code contains another approach for classication of benign and malicious apps. I used Eclat for extracting itemset to be used as featureset and do classification using machine learning. We also used SMOTE for imbalance data.
